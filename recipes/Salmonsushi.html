<h2>Description</h2>
<p>People who are intelligent and cool know that salmon sushi is very delicious. It's a no-brainer! Except that <br>
people with no brains might not understand the excellence of salmon sushi. Well I'm assuming that you a brain-haver<br>
thus I can deduce that you like salmon sushi. Well here's a good recipe for just that! (I'm talking about making salmon sushi).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Salmon</li>
    <li>Sushi Rice</li>
    <li>Sushi Vinegar</li>
    <li>Wasabi</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook Sushi Rice: Best salmon nigiri starts with high-quality sushi rice. Japanese short-grain sushi rice works the best.<br>
         Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool down slightly.<br>
          When it’s still very warm, season with sushi vinegar (or white vinegar, sugar and salt).</li>
    <li> Slice the Salmon: Cut the salmon against the grain, with about 30 to 45 degree angle. <br>
        You’ll need to adjust the angle from time to time to get the proper length and thickness. <br>
        I recommend cutting it to 3-inch long, 1-inch wide, and 1/4-inch thick pieces.</li>
    <li> Shape the Rice: Take about 3 tablespoons of rice in your right hand.<br> 
        Squeeze it together until it rolls into a firm oval shape. <br>
        Try to make the bottom flat with a rounded top.</li>
    <li>Add Wasabi to Salmon: Place the salmon slice on the root of your fingers.<br> 
        Then take a pea-sized portion of wasabi, and spread in the middle of the fish. <br>
        This is an optional step, and you can skip it if you don’t have wasabi.</li>
    <li>Assemble the Nigiri: Place the rolled sushi rice onto the salmon, and bend your<br> 
        fingers to cover both the fish and rice together. Press down the rice using the index finger from the other hand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrange and Serve: Turn the fish and rice and let the salmon slice sit on top of the rice. <br>
        Arrange them on a plate and serve with optional wasabi, soy sauce, along with pickled ginger.
    </li>
